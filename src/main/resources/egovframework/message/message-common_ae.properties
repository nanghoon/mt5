pipCalculator.txtSe-detail4 = The Pip Calculator Uses A Market Price Live Feed With The Current Interbank Rate (In A 5-Digit Format) And It Will Display The Current Pip Value Based On The Selected Account Base Currency (In Our Example, The EUR).<br><br>So, The Pip Value For A 0.10 Lot Of EUR/USD, With A Market Rate Of 1.21580, On A EUR Trading Account, Is Currently \u20ac0.8225.<br><br>Traders Should Note That For Trading Accounts In Other Base Currencies, SuchAs GBP Or AUD, Pip Values Can Vary, Depending On The Current Market Rate For The GBP/USD, Or AUD/USD, For Example.The Following Conversion Formula Is Applied To Calculate The Pip Value In Other Currencies.<br><br>Pip Value = (One Pip / Exchange Rate) * Lot Size<br>The Result Would Be:<br>Pip Value = (0.0001/1.21580) * 10,000 = \u20ac0.8225.
